# Our Helathcare HK api

An attempt to expose site data as an API, separated from the main application logic.

Although all of our data is pulled from public sources that are freely accessible, we understand that some parties may be interested in obtaining some of those raw data for producing their own visualizations/ analyses. Therefore, we have decided to expose our datasets as static APIs.

## Basic API scheme
~~~~
GET HTTPS://ourhealthcarehk.github.io/api/{ route }.json

## Available routes

Please see our WIKI.
